**This repository serves educational purposes only**.

This repository builds on the foundations of the [Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-vue-ts), as well as the [Vue 3 SSR in Vite template](https://github.com/bluwy/create-vite-extra/tree/master/template-ssr-vue). For local development, it contains the [Node.Js & TypeScript Devcontainer](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/typescript-node).

Note that actually running the project locally requires either providing dummy images in the `public` and `assets` folders, or removing the imports / references to those images prior to running.

From the devcontainer, run `npm run dev` to start a local development server.
